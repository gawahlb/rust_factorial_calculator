# Overview


This is my first attempt using Rust. I wanted to begin learning Rust as I know that it can be an incredibly valuable language when understood at a working level.


This Rust factorial program is my take on the classic starter factorial program using recursion. I wanted to take it a few steps beyond simply spitting out a factorial in order to learn more about Rust and how this programming language works. I have started with the factorial calculator, but have also added an option for the user to enter as many values as they want. I didn't want the calculator to be limited, so I used a crate that allows for numbers that are much larger than Rust would normally allow without this crate. I have also ensured that when printing the results, they are specific and will allow the user to see the result of the factorial next to the number they selected.


I have written this software in order to begin learning how to use Rust as well as to utilize multiple different aspects of Rust.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tool I used to create this program are Microsoft VS Code and GitHub.

The language and libraries I used include Rust, C/C++ (for debugging), and the num crate.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Clean up the code and make it more concise.
- Give it more functionality so that it becomes more of a general calculator rather than just for factorials
- Make the information the program displays more clean and user-friendly.
